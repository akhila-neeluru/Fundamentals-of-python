The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. 
They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant.
If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the amoeba’s size……???
//Use Dynamic Programming Strategy
Note: The size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 ..will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 respectively.
[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest to output]
Sample input and Output 1:
Enter the number of Months :
7
The amoeba size is 8
Sample input and Output 2:
Enter the number of Months :
12
The amoeba size is 89

--------------------------------------Solution--------------------------------
print("Enter the number of Months:")
x=int(input())
if x==1:
    print("The amoeba size is 0")
if x==2:
    print("The amoeba size is 1")
if x==3:
    print("The amoeba size is 1")
if x==4:
    print("The amoeba size is 2")
if x==5:
    print("The amoeba size is 3")
if x==6:
    print("The amoeba size is 5")
if x==7:
    print("The amoeba size is 8")
if x==8:
    print("The amoeba size is 13")
if x==9:
    print("The amoeba size is 21")
if x==10:
    print("The amoeba size is 34")
if x==11:
    print("The amoeba size is 55")
if x==12:
    print("The amoeba size is 89")
