A website requires the users to input a username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users. Following are the criteria for checking the password:
1.At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2.At least 1 number between [0-9]
3.At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
4.At least 1 character from [$#@]
5.Minimum length of transaction password: 6
6.Maximum length of transaction password: 12
7.Your program should accept a sequence of comma-separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
Input Format:
The input consists of a single line string inputs separated by a comma(,).
Output Format:
The output consists of strings that satisfy the password condition separated by a comma(,). if there is no password that matches the condition, print "No password matches the condition".
Sample Input:
ABd1234@1, a F1#, 2w3E*, 2We3345
Sample Output:
ABd1234@1

lst = input().split(",")

for str1 in lst:
    str1 = str1.lstrip()
    if len(str1) in range(6, 13):
        lst2.append(str1)
for str1 in lst2:
    for j in str1:
        if j.islower():
            small += 1
        elif j.isupper():
            capital += 1
        elif j.isdigit():
            num += 1
        else:
            special += 1
    if num >= 1 and small >= 1 and capital >= 1 and special >= 1:
            result.append(str1)
    small, capital, num, special = 0, 0, 0, 0
    
if len(result) == 0:
    print("No password matches the condition")
elif len(result) != 0:    
    print(" ", end="")
    for i in range(len(result)):
        if i == len(result) - 1:
            print(result[i])
            break
        print(result[i], end=",")
